# **Are prison commissary prices rising faster than general inflation, and if so, by how much?**

This is critical because:
- Incarcerated people earn $0.13-$0.52/hour on average
- They have no alternative markets (captive consumers)
- Price increases disproportionately affect vulnerable populations
- Family members often bear the financial burden

This project will provide tools to:
1. Collect historical commissary price data from state Department of Corrections websites via the Wayback Machine
2. Fetch CPI (Consumer Price Index) data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics
3. Clean, parse, and standardize commissary data across different formats
4. Analyze commissary inflation rates and compare them to general inflation
5. Generate interactive visualizations and reports


## Understanding Prison Commissaries

### How they work:
- Operated by state DOCs or private vendors (Keefe Group, Trinity Services, etc.)
- Inmates purchase with wages ($0.13-$0.52/hour) or family deposits
- Monopoly system - no competition, no alternatives
- Items include food, hygiene products, clothing, stationery

### Why it matters:
- Price increases hit extremely low-income population
- Families bear burden (60% of commissary spending is from outside money)
- Essential items (soap, stamps) not always provided free
- Can cost families $50-200/month
