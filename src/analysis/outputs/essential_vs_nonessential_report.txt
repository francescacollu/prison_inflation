EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

essential items (basic necessities) compared to non-essential items
(discretionary purchases) in Texas prisons from 2019 to 2025.

KEY FINDING: Essential items have experienced 37.86 percentage points
LESS cumulative inflation than non-essential items.

POLICY IMPLICATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The finding that essential items have lower inflation rates than
non-essential items suggests that pricing may be more constrained
on basic necessities, possibly due to policy or public scrutiny.
However, both groups still show significant inflation above general
CPI inflation rates.

LIMITATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Classification Subjectivity: The classification of items as
   'essential' vs 'non-essential' involves some subjectivity.
   Different classification schemes might yield different results.

2. Single State: This analysis covers only Texas prisons.
   Results may not generalize to other states.

3. Fixed Basket: Only items present in all years (2019-2025) are
   included in the analysis. Items that were added or removed
   during this period are excluded.

4. Price Ranges: Some items have price ranges (min-max). This
   analysis uses the average of min and max prices.
